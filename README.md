# Week-4-Challenge

## Overview: 
This analysis deals with the data of students across different schools and their performance in differnt subjects. The students were compared between grades, different schools, performance in reading and math, and even their school budget.

1. Data Collection
2. Preparing the Data
3. Summarizing Data
4. Drill Down into the Data
5. Make Comparisons Between District and Charter Schools
6. Summary of Findings

## Resources: 
- Python 3.9.7
  - Pandas
- Visual Studio Code 1.72.2
- Data Source: 
  - new_full_student_data.csv
  - Student_Data_Challenge_Starter_Code.py

## Summary: 
Once the data was exported, I cleaned the data by checking for null values, these values were dropped and checked for duplicates. Formerly, the data was summarized by showing the minimum, maximum, mean, and, standard deviation to name a few. Some points of interest were the math scores per grade and school, as well as the reading score, student count per school, and even budget. To do so, the data had to be drilled down, using the loc function in order to locate the desired frames of data. Another point of interest was comparing school districts and charter schools, using the groupby function to gather the averages and totals of said key points. At the end of this analysis, we can conclude that the task was completed successfully, although in order to be presented should it be organized as one sees fit. This provides enough data to have a general summary of the performance of the students across different schools. The values presented in this analysis can be used as a template for further analysis.

## Conlusion:
This analysis was challenging as it was my first time using such tools to implement something of this scale, I believe it was successful and will serve its purpose in providing the building blocks of a deeper analysis. Some of the most challenging aspects of such analysis include the proper structure of syntaxes and their rules but in the end, with the help of numerous modules how-to guides/databases for pandas, this analysis is a success.
